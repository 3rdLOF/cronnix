<h2>Distributing CronniX</h2>

<p>Don't hesitate to contect me if you want to include CronniX on a CD-ROM or other distribution media. While CronniX is free for redistribution, I'd be interested where and how it's distributed.

<p>If you're writing about CronniX or mentioning in an article, drop me a line if you have any questions or just want to inform me.

<i>1.3 - June 3, 2001</i>
<ul>

    <li>Improved &quot;Open For User&quot; such that users other than &quot;root&quot; can open other user's crontabs (after authorizing).
    <li>Added support for environment variables.
</ul>

<i>1.2 - March 27, 2001</i>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug that prevented rereading of a crontab if CronniX is restarted too fast.
    <li>Added &quot;Insert pogram&quot; menu item to complement the drag and drop feature. You can now also select a program/script (actually any file) to be inserted as a command.
    <li>Minor interface changes, e.g. changed button label from &quot;Write&quot; to &quot;Save&quot;, added a &quot;Save&quot; menu item with shortcut.
    <li>And yes, CronniX runs on OSX 10.0 (final, retail, GM, 4k78 or whatever you prefer to call it ;-)
</ul>

<I>1.1 - December 26, 2000</I>
<ul>
    <li>Drag and drop support. As suggested by a user, CronniX now features drag and drop. Upon dropping a text selection on a line, it is inserted as a command in the command field. If you drop a file its name is inserted along with a prepended &quot;open&quot;. This can be used to insert AppleScripts. If the drop is not on a line but rather the table view, a new line is inserted.
    <li>Open for different user. The file menu item &quot;Open For User&quot; will open a dialog that allows you to open another user's crontab. Note that you have to be super user (&quot;root&quot;) to be able to do this. Crontab (the underlying unix tool) will deny access to other user's crontabs for any user but the super user.
    <li>Online help.
    <li>Rewritten in Objective C. This makes CronniX start up faster and use less memory than the Java version.
</ul>

<I>1.0 - December 7, 2000</I>
<ul>
    <li>Initial release (Java version)
</ul>
